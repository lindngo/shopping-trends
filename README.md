# Shopping Trends Analysis

### Overview

I used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to practice clustering data with Python. I analyzed a dataset that contains consumer shopping information to better understand if there were any trends present. Furthermore, I generated various scatter plots, dendographs, and line graphs from my code.
